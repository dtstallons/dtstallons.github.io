I've always been a little different than many of the kids I grew up and went to school with. My interests have always surrounded understanding feelings and actions; and my endeavors have most commonly been driven by the intellectual pursuit of knowledge and less so inexact yet difinitive answers. For it always has seemed to me, and taken many years to put my finger on, that the majority of the interactions you'd have in your life are with others who are determined to be right; they are certain of their convictions, and wholly vindicated in their moral ethos/theory. There is nothing wrong with the previous statement except for the fact that most people are unable or limited in their ability to show their work and explain the bits between where they started and concluded. The middle part, the work to reason a belief from a circumstance has always driven and fascinated me. I have always wanted to know the why and then grow my understanding to a point that I can improve or better a belief.

Through my English Literature focused Liberal Arts degree, my Associates in Computer Science, and work experience in variety of roles wound through my less conventional life experiences like readings, parenting, fantasy sports participation, betting, public policy, economics, and other areas of interest or influence I've been passionately driven to find the best ideas. I like to read and think about all the things that I do and why, and my largest joy in life is thinking about things. Not finding the exact right answer always, but just still thinking and probing...analyzing...and this is where Data Science comes in. When I learned about the marrying of computer science, mathematics, and theory to objectively weigh, consider, organize, predict, and build I was sold. An entire study that aims to problem solve subjective, emotional problems that people wrestle with and come up with a best case asessment of that. Most importantly, an assesment that continually improves upon itself and is always open to new inputs. The ability to be able to have an objective score to a subjective theory in a scientific process was just something that I knew was perfect for me.

And so my watch has started. Plato said, "Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something." I hope for this education to give me the tools to have something to say that I believe in with reason.
